# BMI-Calculator

The BMI Calculator I’ve developed is a web application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). The BMI is a measure of body fat based on a person’s height and weight.

When the user inputs their age, height, weight, and sex, the application calculates their BMI and determines their weight category (e.g., “Underweight”, “Normal”, “Overweight”, “Obese”, “Extremely Obese”). Additionally, the application provides the healthy weight range for the user’s height.

In summary, this project combines web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to create a functional and user-friendly BMI calculator.⚕️❤️
